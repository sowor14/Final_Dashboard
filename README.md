# Final_Dashboard
Final Dashboard of the Data Visualization course.

The execution of the Dashboard is via Streamlit command "streamlit run [app_name].py".
Folder plots: it contains some of the plots desingded as independent programns that can be run alone.

In order to run properly the Dashboard, some files will be needed that provide support to plot maps. As those files' size is too large for gitHub, it can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w5pbQSd0O7WAtxOr47obtnzgsLrfDjcj/view?usp=sharing
The files needed are "vagueries.geojson" and the folder "capitals".

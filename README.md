# Final_Dashboard
Final Dashboard of the Data Visualization course.

The execution of the Dashboard is via Streamlit command "streamlit run mapa_cat_app.py".
However, one of the graphics is a georeferenced one, so it needs additional files that cannot be uploaded to gitHub due to its size. If needed, a .zip file can be downloaded in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w5pbQSd0O7WAtxOr47obtnzgsLrfDjcj/view?usp=sharing.
